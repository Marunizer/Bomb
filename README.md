# Bomb
Android App - B.O.M.B. the movie/actor match word game

Repeat the name of an actor or movie, and you are penalized with a letter from "B.O.M.B"
Acrue 4 penalties and you have a 'bomb', you lose :(

Try to be the last one standing !

Attempted to use IMBD's API for data. probably a better idea to use a scraper in actual implementation

This project served more as a learning environment for navigation through activity's and using XML design
